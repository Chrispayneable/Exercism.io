# Exercism.io

Each folder in this repository has four files.

1. README
2. JSON Metadeta file
3. Test file
4. File with my work

Number four is the most important, as it is the only file that I write from scratch each time, as these are TDD exercises based on the test file.

Please feel free to comment on them, or ask me to clarify my methodology. As this is an ever-changing repository, expect many pushes.
